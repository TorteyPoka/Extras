For competitive programming, master these in order:

1- basic IO

2- Classes, overload functions, OOPs concepts

3- basic containers: vector, array, unordered_map (hash map), unordered_set (hash set), stack, queue, priority_queue (heap)

4- library algorithm

5- learn to implement graph, dfs, bfs

6- more containers: map (ordered hash map), set (ordered hash set)

After that you keep learning while you solve question. For example, learn by google search/stackoverflow when you encounter any problem
